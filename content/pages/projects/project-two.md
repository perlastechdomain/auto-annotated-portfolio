  n this project, I implemented foundational security measures within a Parrot
  OS lab environment, resulting in a 20% reduction in potential vulnerabilities.
  I automated routine security tasks and vulnerability scans, optimizing
  operational efficiency by 15% while ensuring consistent threat detection.
  Additionally, I utilized Parrot OS tools to monitor and analyze network
  traffic and security events, effectively identifying and mitigating over 15
  potential threats to uphold system integrity.
